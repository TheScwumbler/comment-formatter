# comment-formatter
makes it easier to make visually appealing comments at the top of a program

it is just about as inefficient as it gets. it is so convoluted i have no idea how it actually works. with a lot of time and effort i could probably get it to work better but its the kinda thing that you run once per program you make using it, so i dont really think it matters
